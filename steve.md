Hi, I'm Steve!  I mostly go by "showell" on the web.

I am a professional programmer.  I wrote my first program in 1983
(36 years ago as of this writing).  Here is a brief history:

- CS degree from Duke University, 1989
- 1980s: Pascal, Basic, C
- 1990s: C/C++, Perl
- 2000s: Python, Ruby, JS
- 2010s: Python, C, JS, CoffeeScript, Elm
- 2020s: ???? (Rust, Haskell, Elixir interest me)

Some gigs:
- 1980s: CSC (minion), Oracle (minion)
- 1990s: Watson Wyatt (consulting), NXT (credit card gateway)
- 2000s: Merchant Link (credit card gateway), Amazon (grocery delivery)
- 2010s: DomainTools (big data), Zulip (open source team chat)

Open source:
- [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) (over 2500 [commits](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commits?author=showell))
- [Guido van Robot](http://gvr.sourceforge.net/) (project leader)

Current stuff:

I have been learning Elm recently.  See my [Elm page](https://showell.github.io/elm.html) for more.
