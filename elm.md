Hi, I like the Elm programming language.

### Game programming

I don't do a ton of game programming, but building games is a really good
way to learn programming languages.  My Fast Track 
[implementation](https://github.com/showell/elm-fasttrack) is about 4k lines
of Elm code.  It gave me practice on lots of fundamentals:

* The Elm Architecture
* basic data structures
* recursion/graph algorithms
* managing state transitions
* using SVG to draw the board

You can see it [here](https://showell.github.io/ft.html).

### Packages

Here are some packages that I have published:

- [showell/meta-elm](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/showell/meta-elm/latest/)

    This is an amibitious experiment to run Elm on top of Elm.

- [showell/binary-tree-diagram](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/showell/binary-tree-diagram/latest/)

    This creates diagrams of binary trees.

- [showell/dict-dot-dot](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/showell/dict-dot-dot/latest/)

    This just exposes some internals on Dict.
