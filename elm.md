Hi, I like the Elm programming language.

### Packages

Here are some packages that I have published:

- [showell/meta-elm](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/showell/meta-elm/latest/)

    This is an amibitious experiment to run Elm on top of Elm.

- [showell/binary-tree-diagram](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/showell/binary-tree-diagram/latest/)

    This creates diagrams of binary trees.

- [showell/dict-dot-dot](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/showell/dict-dot-dot/latest/)

    This just exposes some internals on Dict.

### Game programming

I don't do a ton of game programming, but building games is a really good
way to learn programming languages.  My Fast Track 
[implementation](https://github.com/showell/elm-fasttrack) is about 4k lines
of Elm code.  It was the first nontrivial Elm program that I wrote.

It gave me practice on lots of fundamentals:

* The Elm Architecture
* basic data structures
* recursion/graph algorithms
* managing state transitions
* using SVG to draw the board

You can see it [here](https://showell.github.io/ft.html).

Right now the game doesn't have a true multi-player mode.  You can 
play against yourself, or you can have
multiple folks can play on a shared (physical) device.  I have started
some code to let the computer play against you, too.

I mostly just used this project to learn Elm, though, and that was
definitely "mission accomplished."  It's unclear how much further
polish I will give it.

- 1980s: Pascal, Basic, C
- 1990s: C/C++, Perl
- 2000s: Python, Ruby, JS

- 1990s: Watson Wyatt (early web apps), NXT (credit card gateway)
- 2000s: Merchant Link (credit card gateway), Amazon (grocery delivery)
- 2010s: DomainTools (big data), Zulip (open source team chat)
