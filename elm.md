Hi, I like the Elm programming language.

### Packages

Here are some packages that I have published:

- [showell/meta-elm](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/showell/meta-elm/latest/)

    This is an amibitious experiment to run Elm on top of Elm.

- [showell/binary-tree-diagram](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/showell/binary-tree-diagram/latest/)

    This creates diagrams of binary trees.

- [showell/dict-dot-dot](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/showell/dict-dot-dot/latest/)

    This just exposes some internals on Dict.

##### Hosting
